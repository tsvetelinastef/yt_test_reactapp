How to build and deploy Modern React App - steps:
	1. get the hosting and the domain name - using "Hostinger"
		- aim: for new site, your portfolio, any website you'll create
		- How to pay? -> "Claim deal", "Add to cart", using the code: JAVASCRIPTMASTERY  ,
		48 Months -> 2.49$ -> Have a coupon code? - JAVASCRIPTMASTERY -> Apply ->
		Hostinger dashboard -> Claim domain -> "gpt3-jsm" (first app)-> Claim domain
		Home -> Premium Shared Hosting -> we check "Setup" -> Start now -> Skip -> Choose a domain -> "Finish Setup"
		100 websites, free SSL Certificate, free email, free domain name
		
	2. Terminal -> npx create-react-app ./
	
	3. creating folder "src" and file "index.js"
	file: "index.js" -> import React from 'react';  import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
	ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));   import App from './App';	import './index.css';	
		3.1  we remove comments from index.html file 
		3.2 in "App.js" -> rafce + Enter 
		3.3 in in "App.js" in "Terminal" -> npm install react-icons .....-> npm start
		3.4 folder "components" , folder "brand", folder "cta", folder "feature", folder "navbar" 
			folder article -> "article.css", "Article.jsx" the same for brand, cta, feature, navbar
	
	4. in file: "App.js" -> 
		import React from 'react';

		import Article from './components/Article/Article'
		import Brand from './components/Brand/Brand' 
		..... the same for CTA , feature, navbar 
		
	5. in file components/index.js:  
		export {default as Article } from  './article/Article'
		..... the same for Brand, CTA, Featue, Navbar
		
	6. in file: "App.js" -> 
		on second line we add: import {Article, Brand, CTA } from './components/';
		
	7. folder "containers" with folders: "blog" with files: "Blog.jsx", "blog.css" ..... , features, footer, header, possibility, whatGPT3	
	jsx files contain:  
			import React from 'react';
			import './blog.css';
			
			const Blog = () => {
				return (
					<div>
						Blog
					</div>
				)
			}
			export default Blog
			
			
	8. in file containers/index.js:  
		export {default as Blog } from  './blog/Blog'
		..... the same for Features, Footer, Header, Possibility, WhatGPT3
	
	In file "App.js":  import { Footer, Blog, Possibility, Features, WhatGPT3, Header } from './containers';			
	import { CTA, Brand, Navbar } from './components';		
	
	... than we include them and it looks like: 
	import React from 'react';

	import { Footer, Blog, Possibility, Features, WhatGPT3, Header } from './containers';
	import { CTA, Brand, Navbar } from './components';
	import './App.css';

	const App = () => {
		return (
			<div className="App" >
				<div className="gradient__bg">
					<Navbar />
					<Header />
				</div>
				<Brand /> 
				<WhatGPT3 /> 
				<Features />
				<Possibility />
				<CTA />
				<Blog />
				<Footer /> 
			</div>
		)
	}

	export default App
